            <p><b>Lorem Ipsum </b>You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave
                like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) The Web is like a dominatrix. Everywhere I turn, I see
                little buttons ordering me to Submit. (Nytwind) Any fool can use a computer. Many do. (Ted Nelson)
                Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more ‘user-friendly’… Their best approach
                so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words ‘user-friendly’ on the cover. (Bill
                Gates) The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there. (Gordon Bell)
                The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense.
                (E.W. Dijkstra) We are Microsoft. Resistance Is Futile. You Will Be Assimilated. (Bumper sticker)

            <p><b>Lorem Ipsum </b>The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the
                patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds) There are two ways to write error-free
                programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis) The best method for accelerating a computer is the
                one that boosts it by 9.8 m/s2. (Anonymous) A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways
                before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder)</p>
